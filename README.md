# User Interface to interact with Next-store-API

<div style="text-align: justify">
This website is part of a backend project called <a href="https://github.com/ThiagoAndo/Next-Store-API.git"><span style=" font-style: italic">Next-store-API</span></a> which is built with Node.js. The project includes API documentation, a Postman collection, and this website. You can easily understand how to use all the routes provided by the Next-store-API by simply reading the documentation and using Postman to make requests. However, it's certainly more intuitive to have a real user interface to make requests and understand the dynamics of the backend, which is why this website was built.

If you would like to check a real e-commerce website which uses Next-tore-API as backend go to this repository <a href="https://github.com/ThiagoAndo/Store-e-commerce.git"><span style=" font-style: italic">Store-e-commerce</span></a>:
